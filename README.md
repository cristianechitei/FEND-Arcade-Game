## Clasic Arcade Game
This project is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree course and was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In this game you have a player and enemies (bugs). 

The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. 

The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, a message is displayed and the game is reset. Once the player reaches the water the game is won, a success message is displayed and you can play again.
